# ML_Projects
A collection of my machine learning projects.
Included in this repository are examples of code I have written for various projects.
The purpose is to provide viewers with an example of my knowledgebase in machine learning/pattern recognition.
The accompannying datasets, images, and resultant plots are not included. 
Assuming you've been directed to this repository from LinkedIn or my resume, you will also have my contact info.
Please reach out to me with any questions you may have regarding the code or my experience with ML topics.
Thanks!
